# Title
#### Voice and Background Bias in AI Tutors: A Controlled Study of ChatGPT/Gemini Responses

## Project Description
This project investigates whether AI tutoring tools like ChatGPT and Gemini give different-quality answers based on a studentâ€™s voice (accent, tone) or background.

We tested 10+ questions in different voices and backgrounds to see if the AI:

> Gives longer/more detailed answers to certain groups

> Uses simpler or more complex words depending on who "asks"
>
> Which people benefit most from the AI response
## Research Question
#### Analyze how much the responses of artificial intelligence changes and varies by looking only at human background

## Dataset

1. naturalreadercom (for voice generation)
[Your Link Here](https://www.naturalreader.com/lander?query=Any+Text+to+Voice&afdToken=ChMIqd2aw6u9jgMVdEFVCB3qLwkzEmoBlLqpj5fLAxu0gKFmbS9WjGhpRtRW85dVEmuF0-e0n0aHFvEv6bJBGzZRlEUROAUTeyJDJGYw-R6EweAMeNz7YzkjG8R9T3raA1HYWcS0bMekKpxLImVjNX3CcFpK93RaeT5nJSfbleIVIAE&pcsa=false&nb=0&rurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.naturalreader.com%2F&nm=53&is=540x464&nx=327&ny=78&clkt=68)
2. Independent Variables:

> Voice tone (young/old, formal/casual)
Background context (rural/elite mentions)

3. Dependent Variables (what you measure):

> Response length (word count)
Vocabulary complexity (try Readable)
Accuracy (ask a teacher to rate 1-5)

## Methodology
We tested if ChatGPT/Gemini respond differently based on voice/background:

>Recorded Prompts
Rural voice: "Explain X to someone with no tutor" (young, hesitant tone)
Elite voice: "Explain X to a top student" (confident, formal tone)

>Collected AI Responses
Compared response length, complexity, and accuracy (rated by teacher).

>Analyzed Data

>Used T-tests for stats, readability scores, and expert reviews.
